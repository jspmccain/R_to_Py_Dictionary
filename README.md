# R_to_Py_Dictionary
##Notes for an R user when using Python

I've been using R for a few years now, and am starting to get into Python. This is a running list of the frustrations and/or translations, where I think "I know exactly how to do this in R, what is the equivalent function?!! #$%@"

The quality of this is tied with the quality of the "dictionary" you use. The one I have uploaded here is just a personal entry, obviously I'm still learning Python!
