# R_to_Py_Dictionary
##Tool for Guiding an R user learning Python

I've been using R for a bit, and am starting to learn some Python. This is a running list of the translations, where I think "I know exactly how to do this in R, what is the equivalent function in Python?!?! #$%@"

The "dictionary"\* in this case is just two columns, the first is the name of the intended R function/object. The second column is an entry that describes an analogous procedure or function in Python. The effectiveness of this script is tied with the quality of the "dictionary" you use. The one I have uploaded here is just a personal entry, obviously I'm still learning Python!

This is probably better as a shiny app or something, but that's for future me to think about.

To use:

- Download the "dictionary.csv" file
- Open the R script
- Run the search_R function
- Smile and be happy because you hopefully are led to a useful python equivalent.

\*not to be confused with the data structure, "dictionary", in python
