# R_to_Py_Dictionary
##Tool for Guiding an R user learning Python

I've been using R for a few years now, and am starting to learn some Python. This is a running list of the translations, where I think "I know exactly how to do this in R, what is the equivalent function in Python?!?! #$%@"

The "dictionary" in this case is just two columns, the first is the name of the intended R function/object. The second column is an entry that describes an analogous procedure or function in Python. 

The quality of this is tied with the quality of the "dictionary" you use. The one I have uploaded here is just a personal entry, obviously I'm still learning Python!

This is probably better as a shiny app or something, but that's for future me to think about.


*This is part of a larger effort that I'm trying to document my struggles of learning new concepts and tools. The aim is to re-examine those struggles if I'm ever teaching the concept in the future.*
